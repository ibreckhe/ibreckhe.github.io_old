		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I grew up rambling around the hills of western North Carolina near the city of Asheville, the son of &quot;back-to-the-lander&quot; parents.  I went to school at <a href="http://www.guilford.edu">Guilford College</a> in Greensboro NC and graduated in May 2006 with a degree in Biology and Environmental Studies.  I have always loved outdoorsy stuff and was really involved with the Outdoor Club at my school. We organized hiking, paddling, skiing and other random crazy trips.</li>
			<li>After college I left the red clay of North Carolina for the red dust of tropical Australia.  I was an intern for <a href="http://www.fieldstudies.org"> The School for Field Studies </a>, a conservation research focused study abroad program outside of the city of Cairns in Queensland.  This was a truly excellent experience, allowing me to flex my muscles in teaching, research, and... well... scrubbing lab equipment.</li> 
			<li>In 2008 I moved back to North Carolina and took a job with the <a href="http://www.sandhillslandtrust.org">Sandhills Area Land Trust</a> based out of Southern Pines.  I spent six months monitoring conservation easements, writing baseline documentation reports, and talking to landowners about conservation.  I love the Sandhills, the rich history, the smell of pine smoke, even the sweltering summers, but the academic itch was getting the best of me. In August 2008 I entered a graduate program in <a href="http://cee.unc.edu"> Ecology at UNC Chapel Hill</a>.</li>
			<li>My graduate work built on the relationships that I formed while working for SALT. In collaboration with the <a href="http://www.ncscp.org">North Carolina Sandhills Conservation Partnership</a>, my lab group and I developed GIS tools to help land managers incorporate landscape connectivity considerations into environmental planning. In August 2011, I moved to Atlanta, GA to live with my long-time partner and work as a high-school teacher at The Howard School.</li>
			<li>In the summer of 2012, my wife Lizza and I moved to Seattle, WA, where I am a PhD student in the Biology department at UW working with Janneke Hille Ris Lambers.</li>
